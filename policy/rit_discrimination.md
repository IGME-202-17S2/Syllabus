RIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website.  RIT’s policies require faculty to share  information about  incidents  of  gender  based discrimination and  harassment  with RIT’s Title  IX  coordinator  or  deputy  coordinators, regardless  whether  the  incidents  are  stated  to them in person or shared by students as part of their coursework.

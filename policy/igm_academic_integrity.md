The Department of Interactive Games and Media does not condone any form of academic dishonesty.  Any act of improperly representing another person’s work as one’s own (or allowing someone else to represent your work as their own) is construed as an act of academic dishonesty.  These acts include, but are not limited to, plagiarism in any form or use of information and materials not authorized by the instructor during an examination or for any assignment.

**If a faculty member judges a student to be guilty of any form of academic dishonesty, the student will receive a failing grade for the course.**  Academic dishonesty involving the abuse of RIT computing facilities may result in the pursuit of more severe action.

If the student believes the action by the instructor to be incorrect or the penalty too severe, the faculty member will arrange to meet jointly with the student and with the faculty member’s immediate supervisor.  If the matter cannot be resolved at this level, an appeal may be made to the GCCIS Academic Conduct Committee.

If the faculty member or the faculty member’s immediate supervisor feels that the alleged misconduct warrants more severe action than failure in the course, the case may be referred to the GCCIS Academic Conduct Committee.  The Academic Conduct Committee can recommend further action to the dean of the student’s college including academic suspension or dismissal from the Institute.

The following definitions will be used to clarify and explain unacceptable conduct.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of specific actions but a reasonable description to guide one’s actions.

**CHEATING includes knowingly using,** buying, stealing, transporting or soliciting **in whole or part the contents** of an administered/unadministered test, **test key, homework solution,** paper, project, **software project or computer program,** or any other assignment.  It also includes using, accessing, altering, or gaining entry to information held in a computer account or disk owned by another.                    

**COLLUSION means the unauthorized collaboration with another person** in preparing written work or computer work (including electronic media) offered for credit.  Final work submitted by a student must be substantially the work of that student.  **Collaboration on an assignment is expressly forbidden unless it is explicitly designated as a group project.**  When there is any doubt, a student should consult the instructor (NOT ANOTHER STUDENT) as to whether some action is considered collusion.

**Whenever there is any question as to whether a particular action is considered academic dishonesty, the instructor should be consulted.**

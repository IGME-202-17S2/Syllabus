## Exercise

None today. ::gasp:: (Though there's still that 2D Clock exercise from [04-2](./04-2.md))

## Readings

Nothing to read - but come to class on Thursday having thought about how you might apply vectors to moving a 2D vehicle (for a game like, say, Asteroids). What vectors would a vehicle need?
